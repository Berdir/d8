This directory should be used to place downloaded and custom modules, themes
and profiles which are common to all sites. Keeping contributed and custom
modules, themes, and profiles in the sites directory will aid in upgrading
Drupal core files. Place contributed and custom modules, themes, and profiles
in the sites/all/modules, sites/all/themes, and sites/all/profiles directories
respectively.
