/**
 * @defgroup cache Cache API
 * @{
 * Information about the Drupal Cache API
 *
 * @section basics Basics
 *
 * Note: If not specified, all of the methods mentioned here belong to
 * \Drupal\Core\Cache\CacheBackendInterface.
 *
 * The Cache API is used to store data that takes a long time to
 * compute. Caching can be permanent, temporary, or valid for a certain
 * timespan, and the cache can contain any type of data.
 *
 * To use the Cache API:
 * - Request a cache object through \Drupal::cache() or by injecting a cache
 *   service.
 * - Define a Cache ID (cid) value for your data. A cid is a string, which must
 *   contain enough information to uniquely identify the data. For example, if
 *   your data contains translated strings, then your cid value must include the
 *   current interface language.
 * - Call the get() method to attempt a cache read, to see if the cache already
 *   contains your data.
 * - If your data is not already in the cache, compute it and add it to the
 *   cache using the set() method. The third argument of set() can be used to
 *   control the lifetime of your cache item.
 *
 * Example:
 * @code
 * $cache = \Drupal::cache();
 * $cid = 'mymodule_example:' . \Drupal::languageManager()->getCurrentLanguage()->id();
 *
 * $data = NULL;
 * if ($cache = \Drupal::cache()->get($cid)) {
 *   $data = $cache->data;
 * }
 * else {
 *   $data = my_module_complicated_calculation();
 *   \Drupal::cache()->set($cid, $data);
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * @section bins Cache bins
 *
 * Cache storage is separated into "bins", each containing various cache items.
 * Each bin can be configured separately; see @ref configuration.
 *
 * When you request a cache object, you can specify the bin name in your call to
 * \Drupal::cache(). Alternatively, you can request a bin by getting service
 * "cache.nameofbin" from the container. The default bin is called "cache", with
 * service name "cache.cache", it is used to store common and frequently used
 * caches like plugin information.
 *
 * Other common cache bins are the following:
 *   - bootstrap: Small caches needed for the bootstrap on every request.
 *   - render: Contains cached HTML strings like cached pages and blocks, can
 *     grow to large size.
 *   - data: Contains data that can vary by path or similar context.
 *
 * A module can define a cache bin by defining a service in its
 * modulename.services.yml file as follows (substituting the desired name for
 * "nameofbin"):
 * @code
 * cache.nameofbin:
 *   class: Drupal\Core\Cache\CacheBackendInterface
 *   tags:
 *     - { name: cache.bin }
 *   factory_method: get
 *   factory_service: cache_factory
 *   arguments: [nameofbin]
 * @endcode
 *
 * @section delete Deletion
 *
 * There are two ways to remove an item from the cache:
 * - Deletion (using delete(), deleteMultiple() or deleteAll()) permanently
 *   removes the item from the cache.
 * - Invalidation (using invalidate(), invalidateMultiple() or invalidateAll())
 *   is a "soft" delete that only marks items as "invalid", meaning "not fresh"
 *   or "not fresh enough". Invalid items are not usually returned from the
 *   cache, so in most ways they behave as if they have been deleted. However,
 *   it is possible to retrieve invalid items, if they have not yet been
 *   permanently removed by the garbage collector, by passing TRUE as the second
 *   argument for get($cid, $allow_invalid).
 *
 * Use deletion if a cache item is no longer useful; for instance, if the item
 * contains references to data that has been deleted. Use invalidation if the
 * cached item may still be useful to some callers until it has been updated
 * with fresh data. The fact that it was fresh a short while ago may often be
 * sufficient.
 *
 * Invalidation is particularly useful to protect against stampedes. Rather than
 * having multiple concurrent requests updating the same cache item when it
 * expires or is deleted, there can be one request updating the cache, while the
 * other requests can proceed using the stale value. As soon as the cache item
 * has been updated, all future requests will use the updated value.
 *
 * @section tags Cache Tags
 *
 * The fourth argument of the set() method can be used to specify cache tags,
 * which are used to identify what type of data is included in each cache. Each
 * cache can have multiple tags, and each tag has a string key and a value. The
 * value can be:
 * - TRUE, to indicate that this type of data is present in the cache.
 * - An array of values. For example, the "node" tag indicates that particular
 *   nodes' data is present in the cache, so its value is an array of node IDs.
 * Data that has been tagged can be deleted or invalidated as a group.
 *
 * Example:
 * @code
 * // A cache item with nodes, users, and some custom module data.
 * $tags = array(
 *   'my_custom_tag' => TRUE,
 *   'node' => array(1, 3),
 *   'user' => array(7),
 * );
 * \Drupal::cache()->set($cid, $data, CacheBackendInterface::CACHE_PERMANENT, $tags);
 *
 * // Delete or invalidate all caches with certain tags.
 * \Drupal\Core\Cache\Cache::deleteTags(array('node' => array(1));
 * \Drupal\Core\Cache\Cache::invalidateTags(array('user' => array(1)));
 * @endcode
 *
 * @todo Update cache tag deletion in https://drupal.org/node/918538
 *
 * @todo Extend entity cache tags based on https://drupal.org/node/2217749
 *
 * @section configuration Configuration
 *
 * Each cache bin can be configured separately; for instance, each bin can use a
 * different cache backend, such as APC or Memcache. The default backend stores
 * the cached data in the Drupal database.
 *
 * In a settings.php file, you can override the class used for a particular
 * cache bin. For example, if your implementation of
 * \Drupal\Core\Cache\CacheBackendInterface was called MyCustomCache, the
 * following line would make Drupal use it for the 'cache_render' bin:
 * @code
 *  $settings['cache_classes']['cache_render'] = 'Drupal\full\namespace\to\MyCustomCache';
 * @endcode
 *
 * Additionally, you can register your cache implementation to be used by
 * default for all cache bins with:
 * @code
 *  $settings['cache_classes']['cache'] = 'Drupal\full\namespace\to\MyCustomCache';
 * @endcode
 *
